## Project Objective

**Why Resume Analyzer?**

Recruiters often rely on **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)** that use keyword matching and skill relevance to filter candidates. This tool replicates that logic using **Gemini 1.5 Flash**, giving feedback such as:

- What‚Äôs **strong** in your resume
- What‚Äôs **missing** based on the job description
- How to **improve skills**
- What **percentage match** your resume has for the job

It‚Äôs like having a smart HR assistant that helps optimize your resume for every job!
